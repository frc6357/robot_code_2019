Base Classes
------------

This directory contains the lowest-level classes supporting the 2019 robot.
Classes here instantiate hardware control objects and perform very basic
control (along the lines of "SetSpeed"). Classes above this will implement
any and all intelligence (controllers, command sequencing, etc.).
